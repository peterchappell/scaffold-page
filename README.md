# Starting point for single page with no frameworks

This is a basic starting point for a new page. It contains some basic tooling
to help get things moving quickly.

To get started, run `npm install`.

* a basic http server - run `npm run serve`
* babel for ES6 transpilation - run `npm run build:js` and/or `npm run watch:js`
* scss - run `npm run build:css` and/or `npm run watch:css`
* A basic testing setup using mocha (in the test folder). It's only set up for
in-browser tests by default.
